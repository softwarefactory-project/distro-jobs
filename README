This project contains jobs and roles to manage RPM build and publication.

* Implement a ensure-dlrn role
* Implement a ensure-dlrnclient role
* Implement a ensure-rdopkg role
* Make DLRN discover scripts and templates dir if not defined

* Fix HOME variable for dlrn wsgi

* Figure out why rdopkg wants rdo-full.yml and dlrn wants rdo.yml

* Add distroinfo configuration endpoint in managesf to generate package list based on repo definition
  -> A distro configuration is linked to a config project that manage the project configuration of distgit projects
